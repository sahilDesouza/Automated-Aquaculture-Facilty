# Automated-Aquaculture-Facilty

An aquaculture facility needs to be constantly maintained. This can be achieved by regularly monitoring the quality of air and water in the facility. In cases where the facility is not maintained it will lead to degradation which will pollute the water and therefore will incurring significant losses to the aquaculture farmers. In order to avoid this scenario a sensor mesh network will be established in the aquaculture facility which will be able to monitor the quality of air and water and also determine the water level. These sensors will provide 24hr monitoring. The data acquired from the sensors (Air Quality, Temperature, Dust, Ph, Water Level) this data will be then be sent to a remote location where the data can be monitored remotely.
The real time data received will be continuously monitored and any change from the normal values would indicating an issue has occurred in the aquaculture facility. In such scenario a message will be displayed on a GUI in the form of a gauge and trends and thereby alerting the farmer of the quality of air or water, immediate steps can then be taken to mitigate its impacts on the aquaculture facility.
